# Spaghetti Code

Team Spaghetti Code for Codefest 11th-12th October 2023.

## Problem statements
1. **Develop a new Referrals & Booking System** - Create an automated referrals and booking system to allow seamless end-to-end referral through to waiting list for clinical triage.

- Current process automatically creates a new profile for a client when referrals are logged. However, the subsequent steps in the process are manual.
- There is no automatic sanity checks for example, duplicate client referrals, causing additional work.

2. **Therapist and Client chat function** - Create a chat function to allow contact between a therapist and client prior to meeting

- There is currently no chat function or communication tool between a client and a therapist prior to a home visit.

3. **Safeguarding Service for Clients/Therapists** - Create a check in/check out application to ensure employee safety.

- There is no automatic safety measures to ensure that clients and workers are safe when a visit occurs.
- At the moment there is a WhatsApp chat, could be improved. Think about similar processes at Barclays.

4. **Digital Therapy Room** - Develop a video conferencing space so online counselling is deliveryable using creative activities.

- There is no access to a suite of creative tools which could aid the therapeutic process for children and young people with Listening Ear's online therapy offer and video conferencing system (MS Teams)
